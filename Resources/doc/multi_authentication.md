Multiple Activated Authentication Methods
=========================================

A user can have multiple authentication methods enabled at the same time. You can choose if you want to have:
- a multi-level authentication process (three-factor and even more)
- or two-factor authentication and give the user the possibility to choose the authentication method

Set the strategy in the configuration:

```yaml
scheb_two_factor:
  # TODO
```

The user's preferred authentication method can be defined by...
